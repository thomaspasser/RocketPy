%% Getting Started with RocketPy in MATLAB®
% In this Live Script, you will learn how to run RocketPy using the MATLAB® 
% environment.
% 
% First things first: clone/download RocketPy's repository and set it as your 
% MATLAB® working directory so that you can run this live script without any issues.
% 
% After that, we start by configuring our Python environment. You can do so 
% by following the guidelines presented in the MATLAB® documentation: <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html?searchHighlight=python&s_tid=srchtitle_python_4 
% Configure Your System to Use Python - MATLAB & Simulink (mathworks.com)>.
% 
% Once the Python environment is configured, RocketPy needs to installed using 
% |pip| as outlined in RocketPy's documentation: <https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/installation.html#quick-install-using-pip 
% Installation — RocketPy documentation>.
% 
% Finally, all the prerequisites are complete and you can comeback to MATLAB®! 
% We just need to set the execution mode as out of process and start working. 
% MATLAB® can run Python scripts and functions in a separate process. Running 
% Python in a separate process enables you to:
%% 
% * Use some third-party libraries in the Python code that are not compatible 
% with MATLAB®.
% * Isolate the MATLAB® process from crashes in the Python code.

pyenv('ExecutionMode','OutOfProcess');
%%
% Note: if MATLAB® is not able to find Python automatically, you may have to 
% run the command line above including a path to the Python exectuable installed 
% on your computer:

% pyenv('ExecutionMode','OutOfProcess', 'Version', '/path/to/python/executable');
%% 
% Now, we will go through a simplified rocket trajectory simulation to get you 
% started. Let's start by importing the rocketpy module.

rocketpy = py.importlib.import_module('rocketpy');
%% Setting Up a Simulation
% Creating an Environment for Spaceport America

% rocketpy.Environment(railLength, latitude, longitude, elevation);
Env = rocketpy.Environment(pyargs(...
    'railLength', 5.2, ...
    'latitude', 32.990254, ...
    'longitude',-106.974998, ...
    'elevation', 1400 ...
));
%% 
% To get weather data from the GFS forecast, available online, we run the following 
% lines.
% 
% First, we set tomorrow's date.

Tomorrow = datetime('tomorrow');
Env.setDate({int32(Tomorrow.Year), int32(Tomorrow.Month), int32(Tomorrow.Day), int32(12)}) % Hour given in UTC time (noon UTC)
%% 
% Now, we tell our Environment object to retrieve a weather forecast for our 
% specified location and date using GFS:

Env.setAtmosphericModel(pyargs( ...
    'type', "Forecast", ...
    'file', "GFS" ...
))
%% 
% We can see what the weather will look like by calling the info method!

Env.info()
%% 
% Plots will open in a separate window, so be sure to run this last cell to 
% see them!
%% Creating a Motor
% A solid rocket motor is used in this case. To create a motor, the SolidMotor 
% class is used and the required arguments are given.
% 
% The SolidMotor class requires the user to have a thrust curve ready. This 
% can come either from a .eng file for a commercial motor, such as below, or a 
% .csv file from a static test measurement.
% 
% Besides the thrust curve, other parameters such as grain properties and nozzle 
% dimensions must also be given.

Pro75M1670 = rocketpy.SolidMotor(pyargs( ...
    'thrustSource', "../../data/motors/Cesaroni_M1670.eng", ...
    'burnOut', 3.9, ...
    'grainsCenterOfMassPosition', -0.85704, ...
    'grainNumber', int32(5), ...
    'grainSeparation', 5 / 1000, ...
    'grainDensity', 1815, ...
    'grainOuterRadius', 33 / 1000, ...
    'grainInitialInnerRadius', 15 / 1000, ...
    'grainInitialHeight', 120 / 1000, ...
    'nozzleRadius', 33 / 1000, ...
    'throatRadius', 11 / 1000, ...
    'interpolationMethod', "linear" ...
));
%% 
% To see what our thrust curve looks like, along with other import properties, 
% we invoke the info method yet again. You may try the allInfo method if you want 
% more information all at once!

Pro75M1670.info()
%% 
% Plots will open in a separate window, so be sure to run this last cell to 
% see them!
%% Creating a Rocket
% A rocket is composed of several components. Namely, we must have a motor (good 
% thing we have the Pro75M1670 ready), a couple of aerodynamic surfaces (nose 
% cone, fins and tail) and parachutes (if we are not launching a missile).
% 
% Let's start by initializing our rocket, named Calisto, supplying it with the 
% Pro75M1670 engine, entering its inertia properties, some dimensions and also 
% its drag curves.

Calisto = rocketpy.Rocket(pyargs( ...
    'motor', Pro75M1670, ...
    'radius', 127 / 2000, ...
    'mass', 19.197 - 2.956, ...
    'inertiaI', 6.60, ...
    'inertiaZ', 0.0351, ...
    'powerOffDrag', "../../data/calisto/powerOffDragCurve.csv", ...
    'powerOnDrag', "../../data/calisto/powerOnDragCurve.csv" ...
    'nozzlePosition', -1.255, ...
    'coordinateSystemOrientation', "nozzleToCombustionChamber", ...
));

Calisto.setRailButtons(0.2, -0.5)

Calisto.addMotor(Pro75M1670, position=-1.255)
% Adding Aerodynamic Surfaces
% Now we define the aerodynamic surfaces. They are really straight forward.

NoseCone = rocketpy.Rocket.addNose(pyargs( ...
    'self', Calisto, ...
    'length', 0.55829, ...
    'kind', "vonKarman", ...
    'position', 1.278 ...
));

FinSet = rocketpy.Rocket.addTrapezoidalFins(pyargs( ...
    'self', Calisto, ...
    'n', int32(4), ...
    'span', 0.100, ...
    'rootChord', 0.120, ...
    'tipChord', 0.040, ...
    'position', -1.04956 ...
));

Tail = rocketpy.Rocket.addTail(pyargs( ...
    'self', Calisto, ...
    'topRadius', 0.0635, ...
    'bottomRadius', 0.0435, ...
    'length', 0.060, ...
    'position', -1.194656 ...
));
% Adding Parachutes
% Finally, we have parachutes! Calisto will have two parachutes, Drogue and 
% Main.
% 
% Both parachutes are activated by some special algorithm, which is usually 
% really complex and a trade secret. Most algorithms are based on pressure sampling 
% only, while some also use acceleration info.
% 
% RocketPy allows you to define a trigger function which will decide when to 
% activate the ejection event for each parachute. This trigger function is supplied 
% with pressure measurement at a predefined sampling rate. This pressure signal 
% is usually noisy, so artificial noise parameters can be given. Call 

% py.help(rocketpy.Rocket.addParachute)
%% 
% for more details. Furthermore, the trigger function also receives the complete 
% state vector of the rocket, allowing us to use velocity, acceleration or even 
% attitude to decide when the parachute event should be triggered.
% 
% Here, we define our trigger functions rather simply using Python. Unfortunately, 
% defining these with MATLAB® code is not yet possible.

% Drogue parachute is triggered when vertical velocity is negative, i.e. rocket is falling past apogee
drogueTrigger = py.eval("lambda p, y: y[5] < 0", py.dict);

% Main parachute is triggered when vertical velocity is negative and altitude is below 800 AGL 
mainTrigger = py.eval("lambda p, y: (y[5] < 0) and (y[2] < 800 + 1400)", py.dict); 
%% 
% Now we add both the drogue and the main parachute to our rocket.

Main = rocketpy.Rocket.addParachute(pyargs( ...
    'self', Calisto, ...
    'name', "Main", ...
    'CdS', 10.0, ...
    'trigger', mainTrigger, ...
    'samplingRate', 105, ...
    'lag', 1.5, ...
    'noise', py.tuple({0, 8.3, 0.5}) ...
));

Drogue = rocketpy.Rocket.addParachute(pyargs( ...
    'self', Calisto, ...
    'name', "Drogue", ...
    'CdS', 1.0, ...
    'trigger', drogueTrigger, ...
    'samplingRate', 105, ...
    'lag', 1.5, ...
    'noise', py.tuple({0, 8.3, 0.5}) ...
));
%% 
% |Just be careful if you run this last cell multiple times! If you do so, your 
% rocket will end up with lots of parachutes which activate together, which may 
% cause problems during the flight simulation. We advise you to re-run all cells 
% which define our rocket before running this, preventing unwanted old parachutes. 
% Alternatively, you can run the following lines to remove parachutes.|

% Calisto.parachutes.remove(Drogue)
% Calisto.parachutes.remove(Main)
%% |Simulating a Flight|
% |Simulating a flight trajectory is as simple as initializing a Flight class 
% object givin the rocket and environnement set up above as inputs. The launch 
% rail inclination and heading are also given here.|

TestFlight = rocketpy.Flight(pyargs(...
    'rocket', Calisto, ...
    'environment',Env, ...
    'inclination', 85, ...
    'heading', 0 ...
));
%% |Analyzing the Results|
% |RocketPy gives you many plots, thats for sure! They are divided into sections 
% to keep them organized. Alternatively, see the Flight class documentation to 
% see how to get plots for specific variables only, instead of all of them at 
% once.|

TestFlight.allInfo()
%% 
% Plots will open in a separate window, so be sure to run this last cell to 
% see them!
%% Working with Data Generated by RocketPy in MATLAB®
% You can access the entire trajectory solution matrix with the following line 
% of code. The returned matrix contain the following columns: time $t$ (s), $x$ 
% (m), $y$ (m), $z$ (m), $v_x$ (m/s), $v_y$ (m/s), $v_z$ (m/s), $q_0$, $q_1$, 
% $q_2$, $q_3$,  $\omega_1$ (rad/s), $\omega_2$ (rad/s), $\omega_3$ (rad/s).

solution_matrix = double(py.numpy.array(TestFlight.solution))
%% 
% Support for accessing secondary values calculated during post processing, 
% such as energy, mach number, and angle of attack, is also available for all 
% versions of RocketPy greater than or equal to version 0.11.0.
% 
% To showcase this, let's get the angle of attack of the rocket and plot it 
% using MATLAB®:

angle_of_attack = double(TestFlight.angleOfAttack.source)
plot(angle_of_attack(:,1), angle_of_attack(:,2)) % First column is time (s), second is the angle of attack
ylabel('Angle of Attack (Deg)')
xlabel('Time(s)')
xlim([TestFlight.outOfRailTime, 10])
%% 
% You can also convert data from other objects besides the Flight class, such 
% as from the Environment. For example, let's say you want to get the wind velocity, 
% both the x and y component:

wind_velocity_x = double(Env.windVelocityX.source) % First column is altitude (ASL m), while the second one is the speed (m/s)
wind_velocity_y = double(Env.windVelocityY.source) % First column is altitude (ASL m), while the second one is the speed (m/s)
%% Time to Fly!
% This is all you need to get started using RocketPy in MATLAB®! Now it is time 
% to play around and create amazing rockets. Have a great launch!
